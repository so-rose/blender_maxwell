"""A Blender-based system for electromagnetic simulation design and analysis, with deep Tidy3D integration.

# `bl_info`
`bl_info` declares information about the addon to Blender.

However, it is not _dynamically_ read: Blender traverses it using `ast.parse`.
This makes it difficult to synchronize `bl_info` with the project's `pyproject.toml`.
As a workaround, **the addon zip-packer will replace `bl_info` entries**.

The following `bl_info` entries are currently replaced when the ZIP is built:

- `description`: To match the description in `pyproject.toml`.
- `version`: To match the version in `pyproject.toml`.

For more information, see `scripts.pack.BL_INFO_REPLACEMENTS`.

**NOTE**: The find/replace procedure is "dumb" (aka. no regex, no `ast` traversal, etc.).

This is surprisingly robust, so long as use of the deterministic code-formatter `ruff fmt` is enforced.

Still. Be careful around `bl_info`.

Attributes:
	bl_info: Information about the addon declared to Blender.
	BL_REGISTER_BEFORE_DEPS: Blender classes to register before dependencies are verified as installed.
	BL_HOTKEYS: Blender keymap item defs to register before dependencies are verified as installed.

def register() -> None:
	"""Implements a multi-stage addon registration, which accounts for Python dependency management.

	# Multi-Stage Registration
	The trouble is that many classes in our addon might require Python dependencies.

	## Stage 1: Barebones Addon
	Many classes in our addon might require Python dependencies.
	However, they may not yet be installed.

	To solve this bootstrapping problem in a streamlined manner, we only **guarantee** the registration of a few key classes, including:

	- `AddonPreferences`: The addon preferences provide an interface for the user to fix Python dependency problems, thereby triggering subsequent stages.
	- `InstallPyDeps`: An operator that installs missing Python dependencies, using Blender's embeded `pip`.
	- `UninstallPyDeps`: An operator that uninstalls Python dependencies.

	**These classes provide just enough interface to help the user install the missing Python dependencies**.

	## Stage 2: Declare Delayed Registration
	We may not be able to register any classes that rely on Python dependencies.
	However, we can use `registration.delay_registration()` to **delay the registration until it is determined that the Python dependencies are satisfied**.`

	For now, we just pass a callback that will import + return a list of classes to register (`load_main_blclasses()`) when the time comes.

	## Stage 3: Trigger "PyDeps Changed"
	The addon preferences is responsible for storing (and exposing to the user) the path to the Python dependencies.

	Thus, the addon preferences method `on_addon_pydeps_changed()` has the responsibility for checking when the dependencies are valid, and running the delayed registrations (and any other delayed setup) in response.
	In general, `on_addon_pydeps_changed()` runs whenever the PyDeps path is changed, but it can also be run manually.

	As the last part of this process, that's exactly what `register()` does: Runs `on_addon_pydeps_changed()` manually.
	Depending on the addon preferences (which persist), one of two things can happen:

	1. **Deps Satisfied**: The addon will load without issue: The just-declared "delayed registrations" will run immediately, and all is well.
	2. **Deps Not Satisfied**: The user must take action to fix the conflicts due to Python dependencies, before the addon can load. **A popup will show to help the user do so.


	Notes:
		Called by Blender when enabling the addon.
